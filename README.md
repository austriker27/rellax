# Project Title

This is a one page website for our little two man website and app shop. We build and ship websites for our clients and wanted a site to show off what we've done, because what kind of website development agency doesn't have their own website? We design and develop solutions for our clients.

## Getting Started

Uhm basically just go to our [site](https://lindahlstudios.com) to check it out! Simple and fun!

### Prerequisites

A computer, live internet connection and probably a modern browser not named IE.

### Design Influence

The site is heavily based on the parallax library, called rellax, developed by [dixon and moe](dixonandmoe.com/rellax).

## Built With

* [Atom](http://www.atom.io/) - The web framework used
* [Apple](https://apple.com/) - Computers used in development
* [Rellax](https://rometools.github.io/rome/) - The parallax library used
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) - Bootstrap CSS Framework


## Contributing
